### Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anuraag Ramesh. I am currently puruing my Master's in Data Science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I have completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. **I am a data science enthusiast who is currently looking for summer research intern opportunities.** 

Ever since high school, the concept of utilizing data to generate insights and making predications, caught my attention. I have been looking forward to working in this domain and perform essential analysis on real-time data. Owing to my undergrad in Computer Science, I am extremely comfortable in using scripting languages like Python and R as well as SQL. I have also spent a lot of time programming in C, C++, and Java.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Solving a classic machine learning problem (TSP) using a Graph neural network. 

In this project, we are trying to apply GNN (Graph Neural Networks) on a classical machine learning problem, i.e., TSP. Travelling salesman problem is a fully integer-based programming model that makes it NP-hard i.e., it does not have a natural feasible solution.. So, we are trying to use the graph structure of a neural network to solve a TSP problem and give a good accuracy using learning instead of carefully designed heuristics. Our approach is to use the state-of-the-art solvers and use imitation learning to get a reliable model, then use reinforcement learning to increase the accuracy of the model.

#### Industy Experience: 

I have completed a 6-month internship as a Data Science Intern in 2020. I was responsible for planning and executing a Computer Vision project. Using Keras and Tensorflow, the objective was to create a model to predict the age of person given a dataset with images. Implementation was completed utilizing bottleneck features from a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) trained on a wide set of publicly available image datasets. My internships have allowed me to gain real-time experience on interesting topics like recommendation systems and time series analysis. I also got experience in dealing with real-time data pipelines including extracting video-based input using Apache Kafka.  

I also worked on many essential components of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing including building a traffic intensity detection system as well as a user feedback reading system using Deep Learning.
